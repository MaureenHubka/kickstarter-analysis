# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is planning to launch a play called Fever.  She is close to her fundraising goal and would like statistical information  
to see how launch dates and fundraising goals affected success rates of other plays available in a data set. 
The project will use excel tools to trend success and failures of theater projects based on launch dates and fundraising goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide information on success and failure rates for theater launches based on launch dates and fundraising goals 
for plays available from a data set.

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickerstarter data set provided is unwiedy in size and information. There is information on over 4000 projects with over twenty data points.
The information provided is not limited to theater projects. The excel spreadsheet provides an opportunity to sort and filter the data into smaller 
bite sizes in order to comprehend the data.  Much of the data needs to be filtered and have calculations applied.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successfull theater launches by start dates from the raw numbers are between May and June. However, May and June also had the largest number of launch dates. 
The larger total number of plays launched during the time period of May to June contributes to the larger total number of outcomes for the months in general. 
A better way to view it would be by percentage of successful and failed plays, based on the grand totals for each month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes of theater launches based on goals does not show a clear trend. Goals of less than $1000 had the highest percentage of success at 76%.  
Closely follwed by $1000 to $4999 at 73%. 
The success rates fluctuated and dipped as goal ranges increased, increasing again to 67% at the $35000 to $44999 range, and then dropping off again.
Although it went up to 67% at the $35000 to $44999 range, the denominator was low for that range, which could affect reliability.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Due to the size of the spreadsheet, pulling filtered data into and between spreadsheets was cumbersome. A clear vision of what data points needed to be pulled and 
analyzed specific to the purpose was dificult. The biggest difficulty I encounterd was the pivot table for Outcomes Based on Launch date. After confirming the totals were correct, I did not realize the totals by month were off some.  This threw off my chart some. I used the demo table to more accurately explain the outcomes. 

## Results
May and June had the highest number of successful launch dates. 
Goals of less than $1000 had the highest percentage of success at 76%. 

Fomr the Outcomes based Launch Date, May had the highest number of successful launch dates.  
Conclusions that can be gleaned form this is that if Louise launhces her play in May, it is more likely to
have a successful outcome. If Louise launhces her play in December it will more likely not be successful.  
Therefore, Spring is probably the best time to launch.
  
From the Outcomes based on Goals, it was found that goals less than $1000 were most successful.  Although goals ranging from $35000  
to $44999 were relatively successful, the number of projects attempted was low, so it is a less reliable predictor. Therefore, we can glean from this that 
a goals less than $1000 will more likely be successful.

Limitations of the data set include the lack of extraneous variables, such as weather and environment, which could have contributed to launch date success or failure.  
Extent of project financial needs and audience factors were not included, which could also have affected the success by fundraising goals. 

We could have used percentages on the Outcomes Based on Launch Date pivot table. Launch date could also have been looked at by year.  
A clustered column chart could have been used to display the Outcomes Based on Launch Date. 
We could have looked at success or failure by country or average dontations with a bar chart. In additions we could have looked at plays specifically, 
instead of theater in general.
